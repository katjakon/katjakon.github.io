I am Katja, currently a student in the Master's program Language Science and Technology at Saarland University. I also work as a research assistant in the [Artificial Intelligence project](https://www.dnb.de/ki-projekt) at the German National Library.
Currently, I am chair of the organisational commitee for the [33rd TaCoS](https://tacosconference.github.io/), taking place from May 16th to May 18th 2024 in Saarbr√ºcken.
